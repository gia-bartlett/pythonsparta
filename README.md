x and y are not good naming conventions. Nor can you use reserved characters (string, int etc).
Be more descriptive with names of variables.
Include comments - future you with appreciate it!

VARIABLES:
x = 10 (integer)
y = 3.5 (float)
name = "James" (string)

PRINT:
The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.
The message can be a string, or any other object, the object will be converted into a string before written to the screen.
print(x) (will print 10)

METHODS:
The cast() function convert a variable value from one type to another.
This is, in Python, done with functions such as int() or float() or str()
