# print("Hello, World!")
#
# # Let's create a variable
#
# my_age = 31
# hector_age = 14.8
# name = "Georgina"
#
# print(my_age)
# print(hector_age)
# print(name)
# print(hector_age * 7)
# print(my_age)
#
# # built in method called 'type
#
# print(type(my_age))
#
# print(str(my_age) + name)
#turning an int into a string is called casting

# name = input("Please print your name ")
# age = input("Please enter your age ")
# print(name)
# print(age)

#Overwriting a variable

# name = "James"
# print(name)
# name = "Bond"
# print(name)

#Python runs top to bottom so name will be Bond in this example

#Homework 30/06
#create a vairable called first_name and last_name
#create a variable called full_name adn display full name

first_name = input("Please print your first name ")
last_name = input("Please print your last name ")
age = input("Please print your age ")
address = input("Please print your address ")

full_name_age_address = first_name + " " + last_name + ", " + age + ", " + address

print(full_name_age_address)
