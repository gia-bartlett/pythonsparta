first_name = input("Please print your first name ")
last_name = input("Please print your last name ")
age = input("Please print your age ")
address = input("Please print your address ")

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name + ", " + age + ", " + address

print(full_name)

# create a string and loop through the string
# print the string on one line
## option 1
city = "London"
for letter in city:
    print(letter, end = '')
## option 2
city = "London"
one_line = ""
for letter in city:
    one_line += letter
print(one_line)
